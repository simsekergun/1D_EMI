Due to GitHub's file size limitations, large csv files (TrainX.csv and TrainY.csv) are divided into smaller files and moved to the subfolders with the same names, e.g. TrainX.
These smaller files need to be merged and renamed as TrainX.csv and TrainY.csv, respectively, first.
Then they need to be moved to the upper folders if you want to use the notebooks as is.
